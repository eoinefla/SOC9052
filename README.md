SOC9052 Longitudinal (Time Series) Analysis, Introductory Graduate

<b/>Brief Outline</b>

This module introduces a range of standard techniques for displaying and modelling time series data in the social sciences. Modelling social systems in cross-section (i.e. at a single point in time), is often problematic; societies, regions, communities, and individuals change over time, and it is difficult to make clear statements about associations between variables without taking account of patterns of long-term change. Time series analysis addresses this difficulty by allowing us to make quantitative statements about variation and association over time. 

Time series regressions often violate a number of assumptions of the standard regression model, and much work in time series involves compensating and accounting for these potential sources of error. Given this potential for confounding, time series analysis in sociology is inherently theory-driven, as we need to specify why and how certain variables may be related, and why variation in a predictor should substantively affect a particular outcome. 

We begin by exploring basic graphics for the display of time series data, and you will quickly discover there is much of value in basic operations such as careful graphing and smoothing. Working with real country-level data, we explore basic univariate summary statistics and diagnostics for time series data, before moving to bivariate modelling. Throughout, we focus on a number of standard model specifications currently in use in social research. This module uses the statistical analysis package Stata, and full syntax reference sheets will be provided at the end of the module.
